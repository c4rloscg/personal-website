Night Market</h1>\n<p>Taiwan is only a small country and is known for its hot springs, night market and of course, food. They also have a lot of tourist destinations and adventure stuffs to offer. Taipei is the capital city of Taiwan and that is its most touristy place. One reason why I want to travel to Taiwan is because of their food. If only I can eat all what I can see and not be full. Food is cheap &amp; very good. A lot of night markets to shop. Friendly people. What&#8217;s not to love about taiwan?</p>\n<h2>Arrival in Taiwan</h2>\n<p>I arrived in Taiwan late at night around 9 and it was raining. You can either take a bus($125 NTD) or cab($1,000 NTD) going to your accommodation. I suggest to take a bus going to Taipei Main Station and from there take MRT or cab going to your accommodation so you can save money and just use that for food or shopping 🙂</p>\n<p>I stayed in a hotel. It was on a good location, few minutes walk to the night market &amp; train station and price is reasonable.</p>\n<p><strong>Fu Chang Hotel </strong><br />\n<strong>Address</strong>: 6, Kangding Rd, Ximending, Taipei, Taiwan 108<br />\n<strong>Price</strong>: 2x nights for 1 room (currency convertion was made during the time I made the reservation)<br />\nPHP 2,517.72 x 3 nights = 7,553.18 PHP<br />\nor USD 53.49 x 3 nights = 160.48 USD<br />\nor NTD  1,732.27 x 3 nights = 5,196.81 NTD</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1591\" src=\"http://35.227.92.179/felixnoriel/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/1-1.jpg\" alt=\"fu chang hotel taiwan\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" /></p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1592\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-1592 size-full\" src=\"http://35.227.92.179/felixnoriel/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/2-1.jpg\" alt=\"fu chang hotel taiwan\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bathroom was okay &amp; clean</figcaption></figure>\n<p>As soon as I put my things in the hotel I went outside to search for food. I was supposed to check a night market nearby but unfortunately the receptionist told me they are closed or didn&#8217;t bother to open up because it was raining hard that night. Anyway, I just roamed around the hotel and saw some food stalls.</p>\n<p>Good thing I passed by one and it looks good! You get your ingredients, put it in a plastic bag and they cook and put it in a bowl for you. I quickly get the things I want and asked them to cook it. I also asked them to add noodles.

I asked them and it was a Taiwan&#8217;s famous fried chicken street food. I bought a small bag and eat it while I was on my way back.

All of the stalls look good but I specifically searched for LAO WANG JI #15 Tao Yuan St. Good thing I have an idea on what the resto looks like and I assumed this was it when I saw a long line.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1610\" src=\"http://35.227.92.179/felixnoriel/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/20-1.jpg\" alt=\"beef noodle soup food taiwan\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" /></p>\n<p>The beef noodle soup was very good! the beef was tender that melts in your mouth and the soup was amazing! I top it up with pickled veggies and chili and it was amazing! I ordered a pork rice on the side. It was good but not great. Anyway, the beef noodle soup was the food I came here for and it didn&#8217;t disappoint me!</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1609\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-1609 size-full\" src=\"http://35.227.92.179/felixnoriel/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/19-1.jpg\" alt=\"beef noodle soup food taiwan\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Beef noodle soup with pork rice and pickled veggies</figcaption></figure>\n<h3>Ximending Night Market</h3>\n<p>Access: MRT &#8211; Take Bannan Line get off at Ximen Station and take to exit no. 6<br />\nOpen: Some shops open early and close at very late but most are 5pm &#8211; 2am</p>\n<p>After having that amazing soup, I went back to my hotel to rest for a while and change clothes because I was wet.

But the thing was I lined up for the bus going there. I was already waiting for 2 hours and I can&#8217;t see me getting to the bus for another 1-2hours. The travel time going there is around 45mins and it was already late. So I decided to skip that and go to the zoo and cable car instead. The cable car will not be open for the next day so I think its more appropriate to go there.</p>\n<p>I rushed myself going to the zoo but unfortunately it was already closed. Ooooh what a day! Good vibes, good vibes!</p>\n<h3>Maokong Gondola &#8211; Cable Car</h3>\n<p><strong>Access</strong>: <span class=\"CuHtmlEditColor993300\">MRT Wenshan-Neihu Line:</span> Get off at Taipei Zoo Station.

I can&#8217;t do anything about it so I just waited. Haha.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1623\" src=\"http://35.227.92.179/felixnoriel/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/33-1.jpg\" alt=\"maokong gandola taiwan\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" /></p>\n<p>Riding that cable car was an awesome experience.

I was supposed to get Din Tai Fung at the ground floor for dinner but unfortunately, it was already closed. I then went to another famous night market instead, Raohe street.

Just get off at Sentral Station and from there take another train to the nearest stop going there.</p>\n<h3>Petronas Twin Towers</h3>\n<p><strong>Access</strong>: From KL Sentral, use the Rapid KLLRT Train (Kelana Jaya Line). Go to the Rapid KL LRT Platform to board the LRT train to the Gombak direction (not Kelana Jaya direction). The LRT will bring you directly to KLCC station and from there, just walk until you reach the towers.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s an awesome feeling just standing here getting to see those towers. I always see it on magazines or news and it was a great experience to see it personally.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1674\" style=\"width: 1280px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-1674 size-full\" src=\"http://35.227.92.179/felixnoriel/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_20160206_130319_HDR.jpg\" alt=\"petronas towers kuala lumpur malaysia\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">World&#8217;s tallest twin towers.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>You can also buy ticket and go up the tower and see the the beautiful city of Kuala Lumpur.

Of course, most of us wants cheap rates and are on a budget. Some tips that I actually do are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>staying at hostels or b&amp;b</strong> &#8211; these accommodations are not bad just check the reviews &amp; feedbacks of past people who stayed there—and you get to meet fellow travellers there especially in hostels—chat with them, share stories and you can even ask for tips &amp; recommendations based from their experience</li>\n<li><strong>eat local food in hawker centres or in streets</strong> &#8211; this is actually a must since you basically want the good stuff and most of the time you can find and experience the best here</li>\n<li><strong>walk to your destination</strong> &#8211; walk it off! you will experience more and see how beautiful the city by taking it one step at a time rather than staying in a car!</li>\n<li><strong>less shopping</strong> &#8211; look for cheap bargains and buy only the things you need; but if you are there to shop well go for it!</li>\n</ul>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1350\" style=\"width: 960px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-1350 size-full\" src=\"http://35.227.92.179/felixnoriel/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/YDXJ0342.jpg\" alt=\"felix in mekong delta vietnam\" width=\"960\" height=\"720\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mekong delta in Vietnam</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>Set your priorities</h2>\n<p>Well technically yes, you need money to travel—but the truth is, it&#8217;s not all about money. It all depends on how you manage things and how you set your priorities. Some people see me travelling often, doing adventurous stuff and the first thing pops out of their mind is that I&#8217;m rich and have plenty of money—that is not true. We&#8217;re all the same who works very hard and earn money, we just have different ways of using it. For example, some people save up money for material things like new gadgets, clothes, shoes, etc and some save up for experiences like travelling and doing activities.</p>\n<p>Most of the time, people who are into material things tend to say that they don&#8217;t have money to travel because of this or because of that; the next thing you know is that they have brand new clothes, shoes and has the latest gadgets. Clearly, that is what they prioritize and save money for; maybe, that is what they want and makes them happy.</p>\n<h2>What&#8217;s my motivation?</h2>\n<p>This is how I invest my time and money. I&#8217;m still young and doesn&#8217;t have that much responsibilities yet. Spending my hard earned money in life experiences makes me feel satisfied. I&#8217;d like to reward myself from time to time by going to different places, trying new things, learn different cultures or meet new people on the road; because these are the things that makes me happy. At the moment, these are what motivates me, keeps me work hard and makes me look forward to something like what destination to go or activity to do next.</p>\n<p>I often spend money on material things and only when I really need one. I still use clothe<span class=\"text_exposed_show\">s even if I had it for years. I even rely having new things on the gifts I receive on my birthday or Christmas because that&#8217;s how thrifty I am! I don&#8217;t care not having the latest gadgets, new branded clothes, shoes or whatever; what I care at the moment is to see the world and experience life fully while I still can; because who knows? I might not be able to do these when I grow old. </span></p>\n<h2>Life experiences over material things</h2>\n<p>Instead of buying new stuff, I save my money for my next trip; mainly because this is what I want and makes me happy. I put effort in doing it and making sure it happens; because I believe that life experiences are more valuable than material things.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, there&#8217;s nothing wrong if you like to spend your money on material stuff. All of us have different sets of interest. This is just my opinion. Because at the end of the day, it&#8217;s your time and money; if those things makes you happy, sure why not—but I&#8217;ll tell you this, 5 or 10 years from now, your new clothes now will be old or was already thrown away; your new gadgets are obsolete—but for my life experiences? I&#8217;ll be able to cherish it forever.</p>\n<div class=\"text_exposed_show\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"A lot of people think that you need a lot of money to travel.

Enjoying yourself as much as you can is what life is supposed to be while you&#8217;re young and able to do all stuff. I&#8217;m pretty sure you will still enjoy life when you start to have a family of your own but believe me, it will be a whole lot different story.

You make good or bad decisions and at the end of the day you are going to live with whatever you did. You just have to make sure that those are worth it. Happen to spent all of your money on a trip and did all the activities there is? Yup, you are broke at the moment, but it will past and you can get money afterwards, and for the experience? it&#8217;s still there and forever will be!</p>\n<p>When you grow up and start having a family of your own, your priorities in life will surely change. You think that you can still do these things when you grow old and already have a family but to be honest, you won&#8217;t. This means all your time and effort will need to focus with your family. Yourself comes at the very last. You need to provide for what they need and only when you can do what you like is when you have extra time and I&#8217;m pretty sure that will only come when you are already old and won&#8217;t be able to do so!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text_exposed_show\">\n<h2>Think about the present moment</h2>\n<p>You are still young and can handle pressure in life. Money come and go. One day you have a lot and the other day you have none. But for experience, it can be cherish and remember for a lifetime. Looking back old photos, reminiscing good times with the people you&#8217;ve met on the road-sounds good right? or think of it like this, what are the things you&#8217;re going to share to your children or grandchildren? are you going to tell them a story how you collected signature shoes/bags or how you conquer your fear of heights by jumping off the highest bungee in the world?

You will actually have a lot of advantage than travelling with someone. This will also help you conquer a lot of your fear, make you a better person, and be mature.</p>\n<h2>1. Gain confidence</h2>\n<p>Being alone on the road gives you a lot of time to discover more of yourself. I remember the first time I travelled alone where I had a lot of doubts and was hesitating to proceed with it even the trip was already booked. I had that fear inside me telling me a lot of what ifs, but I pushed myself and decided to just go for it and see what happens! After that solo trip and having experienced a lot of things, I never have been that happy and was very glad I did it! As a result, I learned a lot and became more confident of myself!</p>\n<h2>2. Be an adult and get out of your comfort zone</h2>\n<p>Maturity is one of the biggest factor when it comes to travelling solo and one way to go into that direction is to expose yourself in the outside world. To start with, you can do some exciting challenges and live differently everyday. This way you get to adapt to your surroundings bit by bit. You also don&#8217;t have to over think the decisions you make daily, just choose whatever you think is best. Don&#8217;t worry because you are still learning and no one will judge you.</p>\n<h2>3. The time is in your hands</h2>\n<p>Want to stay for a week in a hostel after months of travelling and just do nothing? or sleep the whole day and re-schedule your tour? You can! No one is going to ask you to wake you up early morning to get ready or go home because you have a scheduled tour the following day. You can do whatever you want!</p>\n<h2>4. Meet new people and gain friends</h2>\n<p>Often times, it&#8217;s hard to meet new people when you&#8217;re travelling in a group since you tend to stick together throughout the trip. It&#8217;s completely different when you are travelling alone because you will definitely need to socialise, and this gives you the opportunity to meet others and maybe be friends with them. While you are on the road, you will meet a lot of solo backpackers especially if you stay in hostels, which are the most popular accommodation for backpackers since they offer cheap accommodation and good discounted tours. You will meet a lot of fellow travellers who also faces the situation you are into–like travelling alone, trying to conquer their fears, and trying to get out of the comfort zone. Have a quick chat with them and share stories, and who knows, you might end up travelling together.</p>\n<h2>5. Go from introvert to extrovert</h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re an introvert and doesn&#8217;t socialise with people because you&#8217;re shy, this might be a challenge for you initially but it will definitely help you to overcome that. Since you&#8217;re alone, you won&#8217;t be having any choice other than to mingle and socialise with strangers. If you always have doubts  or is hesitant to start a conversation with someone, my suggestion is–just do it! It will not hurt you making small talks–as a matter of fact, they will actually love if you&#8217;ll have a conversation with them. You can ask for advise or just tell your stories. Trust me, you&#8217;ll learn and experience a lot more and be glad you did it.</p>\n<h2>6. Planning your trip is easier</h2>\n<p>We all have reasons why we want to go in a particular place. Some of which are because of their local food, activities to do, fantastic scenic views, etc. Most of the time when we travel with someone, we often need to agree on a certain things like accommodation, restaurants, activities, or places to visit–then you will have someone who&#8217;s pain in the ass for being too picky and it might ruin the whole essence of travelling. However, when you&#8217;re alone, you can plan whatever you want to do or place to go without any hesitation.</p>\n<h2>7. Have an extensive understanding of the things around you</h2>\n<p>You only get a little possibility of noticing the tiny things happening around you when you&#8217;re with someone because you are distracted talking to them about random stuff. Being alone will give you the chance to observe a lot of tiny things happening around you and this will help you to learn more information about those.</p>\n<h2>8. No Drama</h2>\n<p>People&#8217;s attitude changes when travelling because they are in a whole lot different situation and place. This might shock you when they show you that side of their personality. For some instance, you may find them annoying because they are too picky on some things, doesn&#8217;t agree with you, or doesn&#8217;t have the same interests as yours–then end up arguing like small children subsequently having regrets travelling with them–this will definitely spoil the whole trip rather than enjoying it! On the other hand, you won&#8217;t need to deal with these things when you travel alone since you will have all the freedom to do whatever you want and no one will be in your way.</p>\n<h2>9. You will love yourself more</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Travelling solo might sound lonely but to be honest, it&#8217;s not.

on how to travel cheap"},"content":{"rendered":"<h1><strong>TIPS ON HOW TO TRAVEL CHEAP</strong></h1>\n<h2><strong>Search and book cheap and on sale airfare</strong></h2>\n<p>Create a list of airlines that provides cheap deals, be patient and committed on checking them as the prices changes frequently. Aside from that, subscribe to airlines so they can send you emails ahead of time before bringing out the promo deals so you get to have advantage over others.</p>\n<p>These websites can help you compare cheap deals from different airlines:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.skyscanner.com.au/\">https://www.skyscanner.com.au/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.flightcentre.com.au/\">http://www.flightcentre.com.au/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>TIP: Most of the time, airlines give out airfare promos and seat sale starting at midnight, and a lot of people are already waiting and checking by this time so you need to be quick on booking one. Try your luck&#8230;</p>\n<h2><strong>Accommodation</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stay in Hostels</strong> &#8211; staying at hostels is not bad as you think. check first feedbacks and reviews before booking it. There are a lot of perks in a hostel like:\n<ul>\n<li>price is relatively much cheaper than hotels</li>\n<li>better location since most are in around CBD areas</li>\n<li>provides best deals (eg: discounts) on local tours and activities</li>\n<li>social gatherings like pubcrawl to experience local nightlife</li>\n<li>lounge area to meet fellow travellers and have a chit-chat</li>\n<li>free coffee/tea through out the day</li>\n<li>free unlimited wi-fi</li>\n<li>use of laundry &amp; dyer</li>\n<li>some provide cheap BBQ events</li>\n<li>very helpful staffs &#8211; they know what travellers needs and wants, so they provide guides and tips as well</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-830\" src=\"http://35.227.92.179/felixnoriel/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/IMG_20160414_200405.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_20160414_200405\" width=\"576\" height=\"1024\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stay in apartments such as AirB&amp;B</strong> &#8211; AirB&amp;B is something where owners let their flat/house be rented out for travellers for probably extra cash (you can do it as well). For me, it&#8217;s a lot better than hotels, because it&#8217;s relatively cheaper, and it has other add-ons like kitchenette, washing machine, and some even provide pocket wifi(which is a very big plus!). So if you want to feel like you&#8217;re a local, this type of accommodation suits you best! and for some instance, you might be staying with the owner, while for some, they just give you instructions to follow on how to get to the apartment. As long as you keep the place clean, there will be no problem.<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-878\" src=\"http://35.227.92.179/felixnoriel/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/IMG_20160417_165823_HDR.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_20160417_165823_HDR\" width=\"1279\" height=\"720\" /></li>\n<li><strong>Couchsurfing</strong> &#8211; local people are willing to host their place and provide accommodation for travellers for free. A lot of people do this to save money on accommodation. You can do a background check and see feedback/reviews of the host first to make sure you&#8217;re going to be on a safe place. Thinking what is it for them on why they do this? Well, they have a chance to meet travellers, exchange stories, or know more about each other cultures, and for you, it&#8217;s free accommodation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Food &#8211; best way is to eat local food</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Street food </strong>&#8211; Places like Taiwan, Japan, or any other Asian Countries has a lot of street foods anywhere you go. These places are my favourite to go to since they&#8217;re cheap and great! you&#8217;ll also have that amazing local vibe experience. You get to taste what local food really is. As long as you see how they prepare the food and it&#8217;s clean you&#8217;re good to eat.<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1650\" src=\"http://35.227.92.179/felixnoriel/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/13632835_1427516727265795_723874366_o.jpg\" alt=\"noodles soup taiwan\" width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" /></li>\n<li><strong>hawker centres</strong> &#8211; it&#8217;s similar to a food court. All stuff they sell are local food that are cheap &amp; affordable, and it&#8217;s very good!<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1537\" src=\"http://35.227.92.179/felixnoriel/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/29.jpg\" alt=\"29\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" /></li>\n<li><strong>make / cook your own</strong> &#8211; using local ingredients is good and you have the options on what you like to put in your food (if you like to be healthy)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Check for discounts</strong></h2>\n<p>So when you are doing your itineraries, you might want to check out some websites that provide cheap deals and discounts for activities, accommodation, or food. eg:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.scoopon.com.au\">https://www.scoopon.com.au</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.groupon.com.au\">https://www.groupon.com.au</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Apart from these, you can also find some when you ask for local maps, local news papers, or ads/flyers being given in the streets. Don&#8217;t be embarrassed of using one, because remember, every dollar counts. Whatever it is, if you can save money from it, it&#8217;s a good thing!</p>\n<h2><strong>Research, read, and learn on blog sites</strong></h2>\n<p>Read a lot of blog sites and get ideas from them on what they normally do on travelling. These guys already has a lot of experience and will share their tips and tricks so readers can also have the same or better experiences.
